    question: 'In a structured interview process, when should each interviewer submit their scorecard?',
    options: ['After the group debrief', 'Before the debrief, before hearing others\' opinions', 'During the debrief', 'The next day'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Submitting scorecards BEFORE the debrief prevents anchoring bias — the loudest voice cannot dominate when everyone has already committed their assessment.',

  {
    id: 'tm-2',
    question: 'What is the most effective way to close a senior engineering candidate with competing offers?',
    options: ['Offer the highest salary', 'Give them architecture ownership and a real problem to own', 'Promise rapid promotion', 'Pressure them to decide quickly'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Architecture ownership closes senior engineers better than compensation alone. Giving candidates something to own before they accept converts interest into commitment.',

    id: 'tq-3',
    question: 'What is the best cadence for 1:1 meetings with a typical mid-level engineer?',
    options: ['Weekly 15 minutes', 'Bi-weekly 45 minutes', 'Monthly 30 minutes', 'Quarterly 60 minutes'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Bi-weekly 45 minutes is the sweet spot for most engineers — enough depth for meaningful conversation without becoming routine noise. Adjust based on individual needs.',

  },
  {
    id: 'tm-4',
    question: 'When building a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan), what is the most important factor for success?',
    options: ['Making it as strict as possible', 'Building it WITH the employee, not FOR them', 'Keeping it confidential from HR', 'Setting a 30-day deadline'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'When employees author their own improvement goals, they take ownership. A PIP success rate is much higher when the employee co-created the plan. Always set clear success criteria and consequences.',
    priority: 'must-know',
  },
  {
    id: 'tm-5',
    question: 'What is the #1 factor in high-performing teams according to Google\'s Project Aristotle?',
    options: ['Technical skill', 'Psychological safety', 'Individual intelligence', 'Team size'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Psychological safety — the belief that one will not be punished for speaking up — is the #1 factor. Build it by modeling vulnerability, thanking people who raise problems, and never shooting the messenger.',

  },
  {
    id: 'tm-6',
    question: 'In the SBI feedback model, what does the "B" stand for?',
    options: ['Business', 'Behavior', 'Baseline', 'Benefit'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'SBI = Situation, Behavior, Impact. The "B" is observable Behavior — "You interrupted the PM three times" not "You were disrespectful." Describe actions, not character.',

    id: 'tm-7',
    question: 'What is "Ruinous Empathy" in the Radical Candor framework?',
    options: ['Being too direct with feedback', 'Caring personally without challenging directly', 'Not caring about the person at all', 'Challenging without context'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Ruinous Empathy means being nice to their face but not giving them the feedback they need to improve. It is the most common manager mistake — being kind in the moment but harmful long-term.',
    priority: 'good-to-know',
  },
  {
    id: 'tm-8',
    question: 'What is the test for whether an engineer should be promoted?',
    options: ['They have been at the current level for 2+ years', 'They are already operating at the next level for 2+ quarters', 'Their manager wants to retain them', 'They asked for a promotion'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Promote based on consistent performance AT the next level, not potential or tenure. The test: "Is this person already operating at the next level for 2+ quarters?"',
    priority: 'must-know',
  },
  {
    id: 'tm-9',
    question: 'In Amazon\'s Forte talent review, what is the "Highly Effective" rating?',
    options: ['Far below the bar', 'Meeting the bar', 'Above the bar, consistent contributor', 'The highest possible rating'],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: '"Highly Effective" means above the bar for the role and level — a consistent contributor who exceeds expectations in most dimensions. "Role Model" is the highest tier.',
    priority: 'good-to-know',
  },
  {
    id: 'tm-10',
    question: 'What is the key sign that your 1:1 meetings are not working?',
    options: ['They run over time', 'They always turn into status meetings', 'The engineer shares too many concerns', 'You disagree on technical approaches'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: '1:1s that become status meetings fail their purpose. The 1:1 is THEIR meeting for career development, blockers, and concerns — not a project status update for you.',

  {
    id: 'tm-11',
    question: 'What eNPS (employee Net Promoter Score) level indicates a crisis?',
    options: ['Below 50', 'Below 20', 'Below 0', 'Below -20'],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: 'An eNPS below 20 is a warning; below 0 is a crisis. More importantly, if you survey and do not act on results publicly, trust drops more than if you had not asked.',
