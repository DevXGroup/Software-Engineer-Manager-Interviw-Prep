  {
    id: 'ai-q1',
    question: 'What is the primary purpose of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?',
    options: ['To make models faster', 'To reduce hallucination by grounding responses in retrieved documents', 'To replace fine-tuning entirely', 'To compress model size'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'RAG retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and includes them as context, grounding the model\'s response in verified facts rather than relying on parametric memory.',
    priority: 'must-know',
  },
  {
    id: 'ai-q2',
    question: 'When evaluating "build vs. buy" for an AI feature, what should you validate first?',
    options: ['That you have the best ML team', 'That AI solves the problem at all (validate with an API)', 'That you have GPU infrastructure', 'That competitors are not using AI'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Use an API to validate the hypothesis first with low investment. Many teams build expensive in-house models for problems where a $20/month API achieves the same result.',
    priority: 'must-know',
  },
  {
    id: 'ai-q3',
    question: 'What are the four layers of AI feature measurement?',
    options: ['Speed, Cost, Accuracy, Adoption', 'Model metrics, Product metrics, Business metrics, Safety metrics', 'Training, Validation, Test, Production', 'Input, Processing, Output, Feedback'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Layer 1: Model metrics (accuracy, F1). Layer 2: Product metrics (adoption, task completion). Layer 3: Business metrics (revenue impact). Layer 4: Safety metrics (hallucination rate, bias).',
    priority: 'must-know',
  },
  {
    id: 'ai-q4',
    question: 'In a production RAG system, why is hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse) recommended?',
    options: ['It is cheaper', 'It is simpler to implement', 'It outperforms dense-only retrieval in most enterprise benchmarks', 'It requires less data'],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: 'Hybrid retrieval combines dense embeddings (semantic similarity) with sparse retrieval (BM25 keyword matching). This handles both conceptual queries and exact term matching better than either alone.',
    priority: 'must-know',
  },
  {
    id: 'ai-q5',
    question: 'What does "temperature" control in an LLM?',
    options: ['Processing speed', 'Model size', 'Output randomness/creativity', 'Context window size'],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: 'Temperature 0 = deterministic (same input, same output). Temperature 1+ = creative/varied. For factual tasks use 0-0.2; for creative tasks 0.7-1.0.',
    priority: 'must-know',
  },
  {
    id: 'ai-q6',
    question: 'What is the most critical security concern for user-facing LLM applications?',
    options: ['Model size', 'Prompt injection attacks', 'Training data cost', 'API rate limits'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Prompt injection allows malicious user input to override system instructions. User input should never directly interpolate into privileged system prompt sections.',
    priority: 'must-know',
  },
  {
    id: 'ai-q7',
    question: 'Under the EU AI Act, which category requires the strictest compliance?',
    options: ['Minimal risk (spam filters)', 'Limited risk (chatbots)', 'High risk (hiring, credit scoring)', 'Unacceptable risk (banned entirely)'],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation: 'Unacceptable risk AI systems (social scoring, real-time biometric surveillance) are banned entirely. High risk has strict requirements but is allowed with compliance measures.',
    priority: 'good-to-know',
  },
  {
    id: 'ai-q8',
    question: 'What is the recommended approach to prompt engineering in production?',
    options: ['Write once and ship it', 'Treat prompts like code: version control, test suite, deployment process', 'Let each engineer write their own prompts', 'Use the longest prompt possible'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Prompts are code. They need version control, a golden evaluation set, A/B testing for changes, and monitoring for prompt injection attacks.',
    priority: 'must-know',
  },
  {
    id: 'ai-q9',
    question: 'What is "model drift" and how should you handle it?',
    options: ['A model moving between servers', 'Performance degradation as production data shifts away from training data', 'A model getting larger over time', 'Changing model providers'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Model drift occurs when production data distribution shifts from training data. Monitor with a holdout evaluation set and periodically re-evaluate. A model trained in 2022 may fail on 2024 slang.',
    priority: 'good-to-know',
  },
  {
    id: 'ai-q10',
    question: 'For a high-stakes AI feature (loans, medical info), what is the minimum required architecture?',
    options: ['Just a good model', 'Human-in-the-loop checkpoints with kill switch', 'Faster inference', 'Bigger training dataset'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'High-stakes AI features require human-in-the-loop checkpoints, kill switches for fast rollback, ethics review, and legal sign-off before launch.',
    priority: 'must-know',
  },
  {
    id: 'ai-q11',
    question: 'What is Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting?',
    options: ['Chaining multiple models together', 'Instructing the model to reason step-by-step before giving a final answer', 'Training on sequential data', 'Using multiple prompts in sequence'],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'CoT prompting instructs the model to show its reasoning process step by step. This dramatically improves performance on multi-step reasoning tasks.',
    priority: 'good-to-know',
  },
  {
    id: 'ai-q12',
    question: 'What is the AI Readiness Filter\'s first criterion for evaluating an ML solution?',
    options: ['ROI analysis', 'Team capability', 'Data availability and quality', 'Competitor analysis'],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: 'No data = no ML. The first criterion is data availability: do you have labeled training data, is it representative, and is there enough of it? Without quality data, ML cannot work.',
    priority: 'must-know',
  },
